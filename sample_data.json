Carolyn Custis James has unearthed startling new insights from this well-worn story...insights that have life-changing implications for you. Naomi is no longer regarded as a bitter, complaining woman, but as a courageous overcomer. A female Job. Ruth, typically admired for her devotion to Naomi and her deference to Boaz, turns out to be a gutsy risk-taker and a powerful agent for change among God's people. She lives outside the box, and her love for Yahweh and Naomi compels her to break the rules of social and religious convention. The Gospel of Ruth vests every woman's life with kingdom purposes and frees us to embrace wholeheartedly God's calling, regardless of our circumstances or season of life. \nCome join us! \nNote: Childcare is not provided for evening Bible studies.
